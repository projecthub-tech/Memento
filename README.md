# **The Internet’s Playground for Memes**

## Scenario

Memes aren’t just internet jokes — they’re cultural currency. But despite memes being everywhere, there’s no single platform that combines powerful **creation tools**, real-time **performance tracking**, **engagement features**, and a **sense of creator achievement**.

Your mission: Build **MemeHub** — a next-gen meme-sharing platform where users can **generate memes, engage with a community, and track their meme's rise to viral fame**.

---

### Objective

Design a full-stack meme platform where users can:

- Create custom memes using a built-in studio
- Use AI to get suggested captions or tags
- Interact via voting, commenting, and sharing
- Track how each meme performs across time
- Explore what's trending, who's winning, and how their memes are ranking

---

### User Roles

- **Logged-in users**: Can create, vote, comment, and track meme stats
- **Guests**: Can browse but not interact

Authentication is required for all interactive and creator actions.

---

### Core Functional Modules

### 1. Meme Creation Studio

- Upload an image or pick from a template library
- Add top/bottom text with real-time preview
- Customize font style, size, color, and alignment

---

### 2. Voting, Commenting & Tagging

- Upvote/downvote system (one vote per meme per user)

- Add tags or auto-tag using AI (e.g., #cringe, #weekend, #relatable)

---

### 3. Meme Feed & Search

Each published meme should display:
